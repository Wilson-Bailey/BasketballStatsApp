 JavaScript and AJAX
AJAX delete allows removing players without page reload.

Interactive flip cards built with JavaScript (click to reveal stats).

Accessibility and Responsive Design
Bootstrap ensures mobile responsiveness.
Added alt attributes and tabindex for keyboard navigation.
Aria labels used where needed.

5. Authentication and Authorization
Login Required to Create, Edit, Delete players.
Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page if trying to access protected actions.
Navigation menu and buttons adjust dynamically based on login status (e.g., Create Player button hidden if logged out).


Accessibility Principles
Semantic HTML Structure
Headings h2 lists form labels and buttons use proper HTML semantics to improve screen reader navigation and understanding

Focus Indicators
Bootstraps default focus outlines ensure users navigating with a keyboard can visually identify where they are on the page

Color Contrast
Bootstraps color system is used to maintain a readable contrast ratio

Responsive Layout
The site uses Boostraps grid system to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring readability and usability

Form Validation Feedback
Form display validation errors using text indicators and styling that clearly identify issues which helps user with visual or cognitive impairments.


AI Disclosure
Chatgpt did help walk me through how to seed data which is all the NBA teams so the user doesnt have to manually type in the team everytime they want to add a new player. I tried getting it by myself but I found it very complicated yet essential to my project so I needed a little extra help.
